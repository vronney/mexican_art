# Mexican Art, Food and Murals

Project was inspired for my love for the Mexican culture and all that it offers.  There are a lot of things to see, eat and do in Mexico. 

## What I did

- Created 3 pages -- Home, Mexican Art and Food Art
- Used Bootstrap to create the pages
- Used containers to hold the images along with rows and columns
- Applied margins to the top of images to give a gutter
