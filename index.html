        <h1 class="font-italic text-center">Murals</h1>
        <p>Murals of sorts date to Upper Paleolithic times such as the cave paintings in the Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave in
            Borneo (40,000-52,000 BP), Chauvet Cave in Ardèche department of southern France (around 32,000 BP). Many
            ancient murals have been found within ancient Egyptian tombs (around 3150 BC), the Minoan palaces (Middle
            period III of the Neopalatial period, 1700–1600 BC), the Oxtotitlán cave and Juxtlahuaca in Mexico (around
            1200-900 BC) and in Pompeii (around 100 BC – AD 79).</p>
        <p>During the Middle Ages murals were usually executed on dry plaster (secco). The huge collection of Kerala
            mural painting dating from the 14th century are examples of fresco secco. In Italy, circa 1300, the
            technique of painting of frescos on wet plaster was reintroduced and led to a significant increase in the
            quality of mural painting.</p>
        <p>In modern times, the term became more well-known with the Mexican muralism art movement (Diego Rivera, David
            Siqueiros and José Orozco). There are many different styles and techniques. The best-known is probably
            fresco, which uses water-soluble paints with a damp lime wash, a rapid use of the resulting mixture over a
            large surface, and often in parts (but with a sense of the whole). The colors lighten as they dry. The
            marouflage method has also been used for millennia.</p>
        <p>Murals today are painted in a variety of ways, using oil or water-based media. The styles can vary from
            abstract to trompe-l'œil (a French term for "fool" or "trick the eye"). Initiated by the works of mural
            artists like Graham Rust or Rainer Maria Latzke in the 1980s, trompe-l'oeil painting has experienced a
            renaissance in private and public buildings in Europe. Today, the beauty of a wall mural has become much
            more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to poster
            paper or canvas which is then pasted to a wall surface (see wallpaper, Frescography) to give the effect of
            either a hand-painted mural or realistic scene.</p>
        <p>Here are just a few of the most influentual Mexican Street Artists of our time.</p>

                    <p>Both St. Peter's letter and the book of Job reveal, that Satan is not content to wait for us to
                        come to him. No, he is hunting us and attacks us through our personal weaknesses. We all have
                        them. Satan very subtly maneuvers our thoughts, emotions, and surroundings to best exploit them,
                        thereby leading us into sin. If, by God's grace, we have rid ourselves of one sin, Satan readily
                        exploits another of our weaknesses. We know this all too well. There is hope, however. "Humble
                        yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God" (1 Peter 5:6). "Likewise, the Spirit helps
                        us in our weakness" (Romans 8:26). Only through washing ourselves in Christ's Blood by our
                        willing participation in the sacramental life of the Church can we ever rid ourselves of our
                        sins. Satan never takes a break from going to and fro on the earth and walking up and down on
                        it" (Job 1:7).</p>

                    <p>Arie Wubben developed a method to create digital paintings with pictures. These images were used
                        in 2005 for the exhibition “Cultura Latina” in the restaurant Morgenthal in Hirzel. More digital
                        paintings were displayed in the prestigeous IBM Research Laboratory in Rüschlikon. In 2006 Arie

                    <p>Both St. Peter and Job reveal Satan's motivation. Very specifically, he wishes to devour us and
                        have us curse God to His Face. That sends chills down my spine. I want to spend neither my life
                        nor my eternity consumed by Satan and cursing God. Suffering is not fun. Suffering is an evil.
                        Yet, "I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing to the glory
                        that is to be revealed to us" (Romans 8:18). Both Job and St. Peter assure us, that after we
                        "have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in
                        Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you" (1 Peter 5:10).</p>
